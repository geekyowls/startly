# How to Squash 55 Commits

## Option 1: Interactive Rebase (Recommended)

### Step 1: Start Interactive Rebase
```bash
# Squash last 55 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~55

# Or rebase from the beginning of your branch
git rebase -i --root
```

### Step 2: In the Editor
- The first commit should remain as `pick`
- Change all other commits from `pick` to `squash` (or just `s`)
- Save and close the editor

Example:
```
pick abc1234 Initial commit
squash def5678 Add authentication
squash ghi9012 Update frontend
squash jkl3456 Fix bugs
squash mno7890 Add features
... (change all others to squash)
```

### Step 3: Edit Commit Message
- A new editor will open for the final commit message
- Write a clean, descriptive commit message like:

```
feat: Initial Startly implementation

- Add modular project generator with NestJS backend
- Implement React frontend with modern UI
- Add authentication system with optional login
- Include boilerplate templates for NestJS projects
- Add module system for feature selection
- Implement GitHub integration
- Add comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Configure Husky for code quality enforcement
```

## Option 2: Reset and Recommit (Simpler)

### Step 1: Create Backup Branch
```bash
git branch backup-before-squash
```

### Step 2: Reset to Initial Commit
```bash
# Find your initial commit hash
git log --oneline | tail -1

# Reset to that commit (replace INITIAL_COMMIT_HASH)
git reset --soft INITIAL_COMMIT_HASH
```

### Step 3: Create New Single Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial Startly implementation

- Add modular project generator with NestJS backend
- Implement React frontend with modern UI  
- Add authentication system with optional login
- Include boilerplate templates for NestJS projects
- Add module system for feature selection
- Implement GitHub integration
- Add comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Configure Husky for code quality enforcement"
```

## Option 3: Squash Merge (If using Pull Request)

If you're working with a pull request:

1. **On GitHub**: When merging the PR, select "Squash and merge"
2. **Edit the commit message** to be descriptive
3. **Merge** - this will automatically squash all commits

## Force Push (Required after squashing)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will rewrite history

```bash
# Force push the squashed commits
git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch-name

# Or if you're sure no one else is working on the branch
git push -f origin your-branch-name
```
